First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with text highlighting the festival name and the location and dates of the festival commencement.
The main points are made immediately with the hero image
The user has the option to scroll down or use the internal navigation links in the nav bar, both of which will lead to the areas of information required, to learn more about the organisation.

As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
On the Newsletter Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
Once the new visitor has seen the hero image, they can then scroll to the lineup section, which will wntsail the bands that will perform at the festival, providing an insight into the experience they will have. 
The user can then scroll down to the gallery and get an idea of the visual performance they will engage in with the festivsl experience.

As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how known they are.

At the bottom of the page there is a footer with Social Links to social media platforms for the users to check out. There is also a copyright link which links back to the hompeage as a unique identifier of my work.
